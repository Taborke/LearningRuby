#LearningRuby

Collaboration for learning ruby.. resources and etc

These resources arent **all** strictly ruby, but let's just say they 'play nice' with ruby.

For instance, Foundation's CSS is written in Sass...which is written in RUBY!
Ember's core contributors are also **Rails'** core contributors and guess what?

Rails > [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/ 'T3h motherland')

Am I saying that Rails is greater than Ruby?
Nope, that's just me trying to be clever...
See, the 'Greater Than' symbol is used in Ruby to define class inheritance.

So if I have a class called Noob and a class called Hacker,
If I want to say that a Hacker **is a** Noob, then I'd write it like this

```````````````````ruby
Class Noob
  experiencePoints = 0
  hasSkills = false
  isMotivated = true
  def learn(topic)
    puts "I'm gonna google #{topic}"
    experiencePoints +=1
  end
  
end

Class Hacker > Noob
  experiencePoints = 100
  hasSkills = true
end
``````````````````````````
So A Hacker has everything A Noob Has and more!
